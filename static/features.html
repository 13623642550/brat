      <h1>brat features</h1> 

      <p>This page presents an overview of brat features. For detailed
	instructions, see the <a href="manual/index.html">brat manual</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Comprehensive visualization</h2>

      <p>The brat annotation visualization is based on the concept
	of &quot;what you see is what you get&quot;: all aspects of
	the underlying annotation are visually represented in an
	intuitive way.
      </p>
      <div class="image">
	<img src="manual/images/visualization-1.png"/>
	<div style="width: 800px" class="caption">Annotation visualization</div>
      </div>

      <h2>Intuitive editing</h2>

      <p>Annotation editing is mouse-based and uses intuitive
	&quot;gestures&quot; familiar from text editors, presentation
	software, and many other tools. To mark a span of text, simply
	select it with the mouse by &quot;dragging&quot; or by
	double-clicking on a word.
      </p>
      <div class="image">
	<img src="manual/images/selection-1.png"/>
	<div style="width: 800px" class="caption">Selecting text for annotation</div>
      </div>
      <p>Connecting annotations, for exaple adding a relation between
	two annotations, is equally simple: click with the mouse on
	one annotation and drag a connection to the other.
      </p>
      <div class="image">
	<img src="manual/images/relation-1.png"/>
	<div style="width: 800px" class="caption">Connecting annotations</div>
      </div>

      <h2>Zero setup</h2>

      <p>brat is built entirely on standard web technologies, and it
	is not necessary to install any local software or browser
	plugins to use it.
      </p>
      <p>An annotator can &quot;set up&quot; and start using brat
	simply by entering the address of the brat installation into
	the address bar of a browser.
      </p>

      <h2>Annotation of texts in any language</h2>

      <p>Both the brat server and client implement full
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a>
	support, thus supporting nearly 100 different scripts.
      </p>
      <div class="image">
	<img border="1" src="japanese-example.png"/>
	<div style="width: 800px" class="caption">Annotation of text in kanji</div>
      </div>
      <p>Text documents in any language can be converted into 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8 encoded</a>
	Unicode, which can be annotated in brat identically to texts
	in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a>
	format.
      </p>

      <h2>An address for each annotation</h2>

      <p>Every brat annotation can be uniquely addressed within the
	brat server. Together with the URL of the server, this form
	of addressing provides a globally unique address for every
	brat annotation.
      </p>
      <div class="image">
	<img border="1" src="URL-example.png"/>
	<div style="width: 800px" class="caption">Focusing an annotation with a given URL</div>
      </div>
      <img class="right" src="link-URL-emphasized.png"/>
      <p>Entering such an address into a browser will not only show
	the relevant document, but brat will further highlight and
	center the specific annotation. These addresses can thus be
	used in email and online documentation and discussions to
	simply and unabiguously refer to any annotation in brat.
      </p>
      <p>The address for each annotation can be easily accessed from
	a dialog shown by double-clicking on an annotation.
      </p>

      <h2>Integration with automatic annotation tools</h2>

      <p>brat implements a simple interface for integrating the output
	of automatic text annotation tools accessible as web services
	into annotation efforts.
      </p>

      <h2>Ontology integration?</h2>

      <p>(maybe there is still time to do something about this?)</p>

      <h2>High-quality visualization at any scale</h2>

      <p>The visualization of brat is based on Scalable Vector
	Graphics (SVG), which can be rendered in arbitrary detail and
	precision.
      </p>
      <div class="image">
	<img border="1" src="zoomin-example.png"/>
	<div style="width: 800px" class="caption">Zoomed in on an annotation</div>
      </div>
      <p>brat annotation visualizations are thus inherently print
	quality and can be used as figures in publications to
	illustrate annotations.
      </p>
      <p>SVG allows the built-in zoom functions of the browser to be
	used for closeops or for a high-level view of the annotations
	of a document.
      </p>
      <div class="image">
	<img border="1" src="zoomout-example.png"/>
	<div style="width: 800px" class="caption">Zoomed out for an overview</div>
      </div>

      <h2>Easy export in multiple formats</h2>

      <p>Annotations created in brat can be exported with a few clicks
	from the interface in a simple
	<a href="manual/standoff.html">standoff format</a> that can be
	easily analysed, processed, and converted into other formats.
      </p>
      <p>Visualizations can be similarly be exported in their native
	SVG format, rendered as a bitmap
	(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">PNG
	format</a>), or converted into other vector formats for embedding
	into documents (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format">PDF</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulated_PostScript">EPS</a>).
      </p>

      <h2>Always saved, always up to date</h2>

      <p>brat eliminates any risk of losing annotation efforts to tool
	crashes, forgetting to save work, or even complete failure of
	an annotator's computer by transparently communicating all
	edit operations by annotators to the brat server as they are
	done.
      </p>
      <p>Similarly, in maintaining a single authoritative version of
	data shared by all annotators working on a project, the brat
	server remove the possibility of conflicting versions of
	annotations arising or out-of-data data being used as well as
	the need for annotators to use a separate version control
	system for coordinating their work.
      </p>

      <h2>Real-time collaboration</h2>

      <p>The brat client-server architecture and design allow multiple
	annotators to work simultaneously on the same collection of
	document, or even on the same document, seeing each other's
	edits nearly as they are made (some delay is inherent in the
	communication).
      </p>
      <p>All edit operations are coordinated by the server to assure
	that the annotation remains coherent even if multiple users
	attempt to simultaneously modify a single annotation.
      </p>

      <h2>Detailed annotation process measurement</h2>

      <p>brat can optionally be configured to record the precise time
	that an annotator opens a document, each edit action, and even
	the time spent selecting the type to assign to an annotation
	after selecting where to place it.
      </p>

      <h2>Rich set of annotation primitives</h2>

      <p>brat provides a rich set of basic categories of annotation:
	marking for text spans (for e.g. entity annotation), binary
	relations, equivalence classes, <i>n</i>-ary associations (for
	e.g. event annotation) and attributes can be applied together
	in any combination for defining specific annotation tasks.
      </p>
      <p>Some of the many annotation tasks to which brat can be applied
	are presented on the page on <a href="case-studies.html">case
	  studies</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Fully configurable</h2>

      <p>All aspects of annotation are configured using a simple
	declarative configuration language. Each document collection
	have its own configuration, allowing a single brat server to
	host many projects with different annotation targets.
      </p>
      <p>Additionally, most aspects of the visualization such as font,
	annotation &quot;box&quot; and &quot;arc&quot; colors as well
	as arrow head and arc drawing style can be controlled in
	detail using well-documented and widely known HTML/CSS style
	specifications.
      </p>
      <p>For details on how to configure brat, see the
	<a href="configuration.html">configuration page</a>
      </p>

      <h2>Always validated</h2>

      <p>brat incorporates annotation validation capable of checking
	all the constraints that can be defined in its expressive
	configuration.
      </p>
      <p>The validation of annotations created in brat is not isolated
	into a separate process but closely integrated into the
	annotation process: the validity of annotations is checked
	after every edit option, giving annotators immediate feedback
	with simple visual hints.
      </p>
      <div class="image">
	<img src="incomplete-ann-example.png"/>
	<div style="width: 800px" class="caption">Example incomplete annotation and details</div>
      </div>
      <p>Annotations that lack some mandatory part are not given a
	colored fill and given a gray highlight. Placing the mouse
	over such an annotation provides the details of the issues
	detected by the annotation verifier.
      </p>
      <div class="image">
	<img src="error-ann-example.png"/>
	<div style="width: 800px" class="caption">Example annotation with error and details</div>
      </div>
      <p>Annotations that have extra or erroneous parts are given a
	red &quot;halo&quot; that indicates a problem with the
	annotation. Again, placing the mouse over such an annotation
	details the detected issues.
