      <h1>brat configuration</h1> 

      <p>brat configurations are currently controlled by text-based
	configuration files that can be created and edited in any text
	editor. This page documents the configuration language.
      </p>
      <p><b>NOTE</b>: we are planning to introduce <b>GUI-based
	configuration</b> in a future release, but have so far focused
	development efforts on other aspects of the platform as the
	need to alter configurations arises comparatively rarely and
	the brat configuration language is simple enough to write even
	by non-experts.
      </p>

      <h2>Configuration basics</h2>

      <h3>Configuration files</h3>

      <p>the configuration of an annotation project is controlled by
	two files, <tt>annotation.conf</tt> and <tt>visual.conf</tt>,
	the former defining the types of annotations available and the
	latter the way they are displayed.
      <p>Each annotation project typically defines its
	own <tt>annotation.conf</tt>, but
	defining <tt>visual.conf</tt> is not necessary, and the system
	falls back on simple default visuals if this file is not
	present. The configuration files can be placed anywhere in the
	brat data directory, and are normally placed in the directory
	corresponding to the base directory of the collection they
	apply to.
      </p>
      <p>(To determine the configuration for a collection,
	the system searches up in the directory tree from the
	directory in which the collection is contained toward the root
	of the brat <tt>data/</tt> directory, falling back on default
	configurations if no configuration is present in any of these
	locations.)
      </p>

      <h3>Configuration file structure</h3>

      <p>Both the annotation and visual configuration files follow a
	simple line-oriented structure and a syntax familiar from
	many other text-based configuration systems.
      </p>

      <p>The top-level organization of the configuration files is
	into <i>sections</i>, each marked with a line containing only
	<tt>[section-name]</tt>, where <tt>section-name</tt> is one of
	a set of predefined section names defined for the
	configuration file.
      </p>

      <p>Within sections, each non-empty line defines one
	configuration item, where with the first non-space sequence
	names the item, and the rest of the line the specification,
	which varies by section.
      </p>

      <p>Blank lines are ignored by the configuration
	reader. Similarly, lines beginning with the number sign
	&quot;#&quot; (also known as hash character) are ignored
	as comments.
      </p>


      <p>An example of a simple annotation configuration file defining
	two entity and two relation types is shown below.
      </p>

      <table class="annotation_wrapper">
	<tr>
	  <td>
	    <table class="annotation_table" rules="none" cellspacing="10">
	      <tr>
		<td width="100">[entities]</td><td width="250">&#160;</td>
	      </tr><tr>
		<td>Person</td>
	      </tr><tr>
		<td>Organization</td>
	      </tr><tr>
		<td>&#160;</td>
	      </tr><tr>
		<td>[relations]</td>	
	      </tr><tr>
		<td>Family</td><td>Arg1:Person, Arg2:Person</td>
	      </tr><tr>
		<td>Employment</td><td>Arg1:Person, Arg2:Organization</td>
	    </table>
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </table>
