      <h1>brat browser support</h1> 

      <p>brat is implemented using standard web technologies and
	should, in principle, be usable in any standards-compliant
	browser.
      </p>
      <p>In practice not all browsers currently fully support all
	aspects of the technologies used to implement visualization
	and editing in brat. The following table summarizes the
	current browser support for various brat functions.
      </p>

      <p>&quot;Visualization&quot; refers to the functionality for
	viewing existing annotations and navigating in collections,
	and &quot;Editing&quot; to functionality for changing or
	removing existing annotations and creating new ones. Editing
	is only possible on browsers supporting visualization.
      </p>
      <p>Please note the following:
	<ul>
	  <li>brat is not specifically tested on browsers not listed
	    here, but basic functionality is likely to work also on
	    other modern, standards-compliant browsers.
	  </li>
	  <li>Even if a browser is not fully supported, it may still
	    be possible to use it with brat for visualization and
	    basic editing.
	  </li>
	  <li>On touch-based interfaces such as those on the iPad, the
	    iPhone, and Android tablets, selection is currently not
	    supported, so editing is limited to existing annotations.
	    We hope to address this limitation in the next release.
	  </li>
	  <li>There is a known issue with selection in SVG in the
	    Opera browser. We hope to be able to address this in the
	    next release.
	  </li>
	  <li>The above table is based on testing with recent browser
	    versions. Older versions may not support the same features.</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
      <p>If brat doesn't work in your browser:</p>
      <p><strong>If your browser is listed as supported</strong> in
	the above table but brat fails to work, please check the
	following:
	<ul>
	  <li>JavaScript should be permitted. The layout and editing
	    functions of brat are implemented in JavaScript, and
	    having JavaScript switched off either entirely or limited
	    using blockers such as NoScript will prevent brat from
	    working.
	  </li>
	  <li>Cookies should be permitted for editing. brat identifies
	    users by a session cookie, so users who refuse cookies
	    cannot be verified as having editing permissions. Cookies
	    can be switched off for visualization, and brat does not
	    store any cookies or other identifying information of
	    users who are not logged in.
	  </li>
	  <li>The browser should be a relatively recent version. Older
	    versions of supported browsers may work partially or not
	    at all. Please consider upgrading if you are running an
	    older version.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </p> 
      <p><strong>If your browser is listed as <i>not</i>
	  supported</strong>, please consider installing a supported
	browser. Most of the supported browsers are freely
	available, and installation only takes a couple of
	minutes. (You can also try badgering the developers to add
	support for your browser!)
      </p>
      <h3>Why is browser X not supported?</h3>
      <p>Most likely because the browser does not implement support for
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">Scalable
	Vector Graphics</a> (SVG).
      </p>
      <p>The core of brat visualization is based on SVG. Although SVG
	has been a recommended web standard for over a decade, not all
	browsers have implemented it; in particular, Internet Explorer
	has only started supporting SVG from version 9. Because SVG is
	central to the brat visualization, supporting browsers that do
	not implement it would require rewriting much of the brat
	client.
