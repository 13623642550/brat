      <h1>brat troubleshooting</h1> 

      <p>This document provides information on how to address specific
	problems with brat. For general instructions on use, see the
	<a href="index.html">brat manual</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="client-trouble">Trouble using brat</h2>

      <p>This section relates to issues using an existing brat
	installation that has been working for other users (client and
	UI issues). If you have trouble creating a new installation of
	brat on a server, skip to the
	<a href="#server-trouble">section on installation</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>1) brat fails to start, or some features do not work</h3>

      <div style="color:#666666; width:30%; float:right; margin:auto; padding-left:5em">
      <b>Sidebar: why is browser X not supported?</b>
      <p>Most likely because the browser does not fully implement
	support for
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">Scalable
	Vector Graphics</a> (SVG).
      </p>
      <p>The core of brat visualization is based on SVG. Although SVG
	has been a recommended web standard for over a decade, not all
	browsers have implemented it; in particular, Internet Explorer
	has only started supporting SVG from version 9. Because SVG is
	central to the brat visualization, supporting browsers that do
	not implement it would require rewriting much of the brat
	client. There are currently no plans to do this, and we ask
	users of browsers that do not implement SVG support to
	consider using one of the many supported browsers when using
	brat.
      </p>
      </div>
      
      <p>It may be that your browser is not fully supported. Please
	check your browser on the 
	<a href="supported-browsers.html">brat browser support</a>
	page.
      </p>

      <p><strong>If your browser is listed as supported</strong>
	but brat fails to work, please check the following:
	<ul>
	  <li>JavaScript should be permitted. The layout and editing
	    functions of brat are implemented in JavaScript, and
	    having JavaScript switched off either entirely or limited
        using blockers such as <a href="http://noscript.net/">NoScript</a>
        will prevent brat from working.
	  </li>
	  <li>Cookies should be permitted for editing. brat identifies
	    users by a session cookie, so users who refuse cookies
	    cannot be verified as having editing permissions. (Cookies
	    can be switched off for visualization.)
	  </li>
	  <li>The browser should be a relatively recent version. Older
	    versions of supported browsers may work partially or not
	    at all. Please consider upgrading if you are running an
	    older version.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </p> 
      <p><strong>If your browser is listed as <i>not</i>
	  supported</strong>, please consider installing a supported
	browser. Most of the supported browsers are freely
	available, and installation only takes a couple of
	minutes. (You can also try pushing the brat developers to
	improve support for your browser!)
      </p>

      <h3>2) brat works, but is slow</h3>

      <p>This issue may relate to the browser, the system used to run
	it, server load, or document size.
      </p>

      <p><b>Browser</b> implementations of the core technologies used
	to implement brat (vector graphics and JavaScript) have
	greatly improved recently, and installing the latest version
	of your favorite browser may resolve the issue. There are also
	known differences in the efficiency of various browsers'
	implementations of these technologies, and trying a different
	browser may help. brat is known to work well on recent
	versions of the <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google
	Chrome</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Apple
	Safari</a> browsers.
      </p>

      <p><b>System</b> requirements for running the brat client are
	not high, and most modern machines (including laptops) should
	be able to run brat without noticeable slowdown. However,
	low-powered or memory-limited platforms such as smartphones
	and older tablets as well as old machines may be unable to run
	efficiently. Processing and memory requirements can be reduced
	by limiting the size of collections and documents accessed on
	such devices.
      </p>

      <p><b>Server</b> requirements for running brat are also quite
	modest, but heavy server load will be noticed also as slowdown
	on brat clients accessing the server. If you are running both
	the brat client and server on the same machine, try
	closing down other programs to release server resources.
      </p>

      <p><b>Document</b> size increases processing power requirements
	on brat. The system does not yet implement progressive or
	partial rendering; that is, the whole document is always
	rendered even though most of it may not be shown on-screen.
	We hope to address this limitation in a future release, but
	for the current version we suggest to partition large
	documents into smaller sections for annotation.
      </p>

      <h3>3) brat was working, but crashed or misbehaved</h3>

      <p>(<b>in short</b>: try reloading the page.</b>)</p>

      <p>You may have encountered a bug in brat. Please contact the
	developers and report the issue! We should be able to fix
	this, in particular if the issue repeats when you perform a
	particular sequence of actions.
      </p>

      <p>(It is also possible that you are encountering a browser
	bug. Though relatively rare, they do occur. In this case
	updating your browser might help.)

      <p>In general, you should be able to recover from a brat
	&quot;crash&quot; or &quot;hang&quot; simply by reloading the
	page in your browser (or, in case of browser bug, reloading
	the browser). <span style="color:green"><b>It is always safe
	  to reload brat</b></span>: you will not lose any of your
	work; all annotations are immediately stored on the server
	as soon as you make them.
      </p>

      <h2 id="server-trouble">Trouble installing brat on a server</h2>

      <h3>Only a defunct menu bar on a blank screen is shown</h3>
      <p>It is possible that the brat server script <tt>ajax.cgi</tt>
	is not being executed by your web server.
      </p>
      <p>To check if this is the case, point a browser directly at the
	<tt>ajax.cgi</tt> script: if your brat installation is located
	at, for example, <tt>http://127.0.0.1/~brat/</tt>, try
	entering the URL <tt>http://127.0.0.1/~brat/ajax.cgi</tt>. If
	this gives an &quot;internal server error&quot; or similar
	message, the script is not being executed. (If you receive a
	&quot;no action&quot; message from brat, the issue is
	elsewhere.)
      </p>
      <p>To fix this, verify that your web server is configured to
	allow the execution of CGI scripts in the directory into which
	brat is installed (see <a href="installation.html">installation 
	instructions</a>) and that the script <tt>ajax.cgi</tt> is
	executable by the web server.
