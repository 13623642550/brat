    <h2>Visualization</h2>
    <p>When a document is selected, the main window area shows a
      visualization of the text and annotations of that
      document.
    </p>
    <img src="images/visualization-1.png"/>
    <p>Placing the mouse cursor over an annotation shows some further
      information about that annotation, including the full form of
      the annotation type, the annotation ID, and any attributes or
      notes attached to the annotation.
    </p>

    <h2>Menu</h2>
    <p>Placing the mouse cursor over the top bar of the window opens the
    tool menu which drops down from the top of the screen. Once the mouse
    pointer leaves the menu area the menu will disappear, thus allowing more
    screen space for the annotations by only appearing when needed.
      </p>
    <img src="images/menu-1.png"/>
    <p>The menu provides access to the following features:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Collection</b>: annotation collection browser</li>
        <li><b>Data</b>: export annotation data</li>
        <li><b>Search</b>: search current collection</li>
        <li><b>Options</b>: system configuration options</li>
        <li><b>Login</b>: log in for editing</li>
      </ul>
      (Exported data is downloaded in raw text for the document, in a
      <a href="http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/SharedTask/detail.shtml#format">in stand-off format</a> for annotations, and in SVG format for
      the visualization.)
    </p>

    <h2>Collection browser</h2> 
    <p>The collection browser, accessible from the menu or by pressing
      the tab key, allows you to access the different text collections
      and individual documents in those collections set up on your
      installation.
    </p>
    <img src="images/collection-browser-1.png"/>

    <h2>Basic editing</h2>
    <p>To edit annotations, users first need to log in by clicking on
      the &quot;Login&quot; button and enter a valid username and
      password in the login dialog.
    <p>
      
    <p>When logged in, it is possible to add annotations for a text
      span simply by selecting that span with the mouse.
    </p>
    <img src="images/selection-1.png"/>
    <p>Selection can be performed either by &quot;dragging&quot; over
      the text or by double-clicking on a word.
    </p>
    <p><b>Note</b>: a multi-word span can also be selected with two
      double-clicks on the first and last words by holding CTRL during
      the first double-click and holding down shift during the
      second double-click.
    </p>
    <p>After selecting a span, the system shows the span annotation
      dialog.
    </p>
    <img src="images/span-dialog-1.png"/>
    <p>
      This allows the selection of the type to assign to the newly
      created annotation, as well as the addition of comments or
      setting additional aspects of the annotation such as attribute
      values (if available).
    </p>
    <p>
      The types available for annotation and additional aspects 
      that are available for marking depend on the configuration of
      the current collection.
    </p>
    <p>Associations between annotated text spans can be annotated by
      &quot;dragging&quot; the mouse from one annotation to the
      other.
    </p>
    <img src="images/relation-1.png"/>
    <p>
      Releasing the mouse pointer over another annotation again brings
      up a dialog for selecting the type of the annotation.
    </p>
    <img src="images/arc-dialog-1.png"/>
    <p>
      The types available for selection in this dialog depend both on
      the configuration of the collection and the types of the two
      selected annotations.
    </p>
    <p>
      (When attempting to associate annotations that do not have any
      configured annotation types that can connect them, an error
      message will be shown instead of this dialog.)
    </p>

    <p>Existing annotations can be modified or deleted from the same
      annotation dialog, which can be brought up by double-clicking
      on an annotation.
    </p>
    <p>(The available annotation types and other aspects depend on the
      configuration of each collection.)
    </p>
