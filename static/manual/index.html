    <h3>Visualization</h3>
    <p>When a document is selected, the main window area shows a
      visualization of the text and annotations of that
      document.
    </p>
    <img src="images/visualization-1.png"/>
    <p>Placing the mouse cursor over an annotation shows some
      further information about that annotation.
    </p>

    <h3>Menu</h3>
    <p>Placing the mouse cursor over the top bar of the window opens the
      tool menu.
      </p>
    <img src="images/menu-1.png"/>
    <p>The menu provides access to the following features:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Collection</b>: annotation collection browser</li>
        <li><b>Search</b>: search current collection</li>
        <li><b>Abbreviations</b>: toggle use of abbreviations in visualization</li>
        <li><b>Login</b>: log in for editing</li>
      </ul>
      The menu also contains download links for the raw text, the
      annotations in standoff format, and the visualization in SVG
      format.
    </p>

    <h3>Collection browser</h3> 
    <p>The collection browser, accessible from the menu or by pressing
      the tab key, allows you to access the different text collections
      and individual documents in those collections set up on your
      installation.
    </p>

    <h3>Basic editing</h3>
    <p>When logged in (from the menu), it is possible to add
      annotations for a text span simply by selecting that span with
      the mouse(either by &quot;dragging&quot; over the text or by
      double-clicking on a word).
    </p>
    <p>After selecting a span, the system shows the annotation dialog.
      This allows the selection of the type to assign to the newly
      created annotation, as well as the addition of comments or
      setting additional aspects of the annotation.
    </p>
    <p>Associations between annotated text spans can be annotated by
      &quot;dragging&quot; with the mouse from one annotation to the
      other. This again brings up a dialog for selecting the type of
      the annotation.
    </p>
    <p>Existing annotations can be modified or deleted from the same
      annotation dialog, which can be brought up by double-clicking
      on an annotation.
    </p>
    <p>(The available annotation types and other aspects depend on the
      configuration of each collection.)
    </p>
