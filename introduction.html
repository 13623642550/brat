      <h1>mini-introduction to brat</h1> 
      
      <p>brat is a web-based tool for text annotation; that is, for
	adding notes to existing text documents.
      </p>
      <p>brat is designed in particular for <i>structured</i>
	annotation, where the notes are not freeform text but have a
	fixed form that can be automatically processed and
	interpreted by a computer.
      </p>
      <p>the following screenshot shows a simple example where a
	sentence has been annotated to identify mentions of some
	real-world entities (things) and their types, and
	a relation between two.
      </p>
      <div class="image">
	<img src="img/annotation-example.png" alt="example annotation"/>
	<div style="width: 790px" class="caption">example annotations (following in part the <a href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/ace/2005/">ACE 2005</a> entity and relation annotation guidelines)</div>
      </div>
      <p>this example illustrates two basic categories of annotation:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><b>text span</b> annotations, such as those marked with
	  the <span class="tt">Organization</span> and <span class="tt">Person</span> types in the
	  example
	</li>
	<li><b>relation</b> annotations, such as the <span class="tt">Family</span>
	  relation in the example
	</li>
      </ul>
      <p>the simple typed text span category is suitable for creating
	annotations for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition">named entity recognition</a>, and binary relations for
	simple relational <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_extraction">information extraction</a> tasks, among others.
      </p>
      <p>brat also supports the annotation of <b><i>n</i>-ary
	associations</b> that can link together any number of other
	annotations participating in specific roles. This category of
	annotation can be used for example for <i>event
	annotation</i>, such as <span class="tt">TRANSFER</span> in the following
	example:
      </p>
      <div class="image">
	<img src="img/event-example.png" alt="example annotation"/>
	<div style="width: 790px" class="caption">example annotations (following in part the <a href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/ace/2005/">ACE 2005</a> entity, relation and event annotation guidelines)</div>
      </div>
      <p>the detailed types and properties of other annotations can be
	further specified through the use of <b>attributes</b> that
	can be set on annotations, for example marking an event as
	being factual or speculative, or marking an entity mention as
	referring to a group or an individual.
      </p>
      <p>to allow the unique identification of the real-world entities
	referred to by specific text expressions, brat supports also
	<b>normalization</b> annotations (brat v1.3 (Crunchy Frog) and newer) that
	associate other annotations with entries in resources such as
	Wikipedia:
      </p>
      <div class="image">
	<img src="img/normalization-example.png" alt="example annotation"/>
	<div style="width: 790px" class="caption">information popup for normalized annotation showing information from Wikipedia (image &copy; Andr&eacute;s Monroy, licensed CC-BY-SA)</div>
      </div>
      <p>finally, although not a primary focus of the tool, brat does
	also allow freeform text &quot;<b>notes</b>&quot; to be added
	to an annotation.
      </p>
<!--       <div class="image"> -->
<!-- 	<img src="img/annotation-note.png" alt="example annotation"/> -->
<!-- 	<div style="width: 790px" class="caption">annotation with text note</div> -->
<!--       </div> -->
      <p>
	the applied categories of annotations, their types, and the
	<b>constraints</b> regarding their use (for example, that a
	<span class="tt">Family</span> relation must always connect annotations of
	the <span class="tt">Person</span> type) are all fully configurable, allowing
	brat to be applied to nearly any text annotation task.
      </p>

      <p>brat also implements a number of features relying on 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a> techniques to support human annotation efforts.
