Editing text span annotations

To modify or delete text span annotations, double-click on the "box" containing the annotation type.

This will open a dialog similar to the one you saw when creating the annotations (hint: like all dialogs in brat, this can be closed also by pressing ESC).

The following sentence contains some extra annotations; use the "Delete" button in the "Edit Annotation" dialog to remove these.


1 ) This sentence contains no mentions of anything of interest and shouldn't have any annotations.


The annotations in the following sentence are otherwise OK, but their spans include some extra words; use the "Move" button in the "Edit Annotation" dialog to move the spans to the right places.


2 ) This sentence mentions some proteins, but they are misannotated: we study p53 and p105 phosphorylation.


Similarily you can also change the type of an existing annotation by opening the "Edit Annotation" dialog and select a different type than the current one. Try it out on the sentence below.

3 ) No matter what the annotation says, p53 is a protein and not a chemical.
