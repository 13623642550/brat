Logging in

Many functions in brat, such as adding and changing annotations, can only be performed by users who are logged in.

User and password management is handled by the administrator of your brat installation, and you may have already received a username and password from your administrator.

Much of the remainder of this tutorial assumes that you have a username and password; if you do not have one already, this would be a good time to ask your brat installation administrator for this information.

Try logging in and out now, and make sure you are logged in before proceeding with this tutorial.
