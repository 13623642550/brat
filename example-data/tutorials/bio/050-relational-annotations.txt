Relational annotations

Text span annotations on their own are building blocks for more sophisticated annotations. We will now introduce relational annotations between existing text span annotations, below is an example of marking equivalences.

1 ) Cellular tumor antigen p53 is the recommended name for p52 according to UniProt, but some alternative names are Antigen NY-CO-13, Phosphoprotein p53 and Tumor suppressor p53.

You create relational annotations by single-clicking on an annotation box and then dragging the mouse pointer to another annotation box. When you are dragging an arrow should appear, originating from the box which you started dragging from. Try marking the "Chemical" annotations in the sentence below as being equivalent.

2 ) Aspirin, or acetylsalicylic acid; also go by the names 2-acetyloxybenzoic acid, acetylsalicylate, acetylsalicylic acid and O-acetylsalicylic acid.

You can also remove relational annotations similarily to how you removed textual spans. Simply double-click on an arc between two members and select delete in the dialog. Try this out on the sentence below that marks two different chemicals as being the same.

3 ) Paracetamol, or acetaminophen; is not the same as aspirin.
