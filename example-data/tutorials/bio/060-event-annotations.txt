Event annotations

One of the more advanced types of annotations available in brat is the event annotation. These are n-ary relations that originate from a trigger word. All-in-all, this is a bit of a mouthful. So let us use an example.

1 ) PI3K is required for p21 expression.

In the above example we can see two events and their respective arguments. The events originate from so-called "triggers" and carry a distinct type assigned by the annotators. Once the trigger and type has been selected the arguments are annotate in by dragging and dropping, just as was done for binary relations. Try replicating the above event structures from the first sentence for the sentence below.

2 ) PI3K is required for p21 expression.

brat allows you to adjust the span and type of arguments and triggers, as well as re-targetting the arguments of events after they have been created. All of this using the same methods we learned in the previous parts of this tutorial. Try it out to correct the annotations below.
