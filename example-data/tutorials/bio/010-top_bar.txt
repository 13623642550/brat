Top bar and menu

As you may have already noticed, brat has a blue top bar that opens the menu when you place the mouse cursor over it.

Once the mouse pointer leaves the menu area the menu will disappear, thus allowing more screen space for text and annotations.

The menu provides access to various dialogs for working with text and annotations that we will discuss later in this tutorial, as well as a button for logging in in (or out) of brat.

Finally, you should find a "help" link in the menu, which will open the brat manual in a separate page if clicked.
