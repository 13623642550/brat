[labels]

# Label definitions for display. The labels are separated by pipe
# characters "|".

# The first label must correspond to the form found first in other
# configuration files. As this form must be valid for use in e.g. the
# BioNLP ST standoff format, it must have only ASCII alphanumerics,
# "_" or "-" (i.e. match '^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]$').

# Labels other than the first define forms that are presented to the
# user in the annotation interface, with the first form being the
# preferred full form and the others abbreviations that will be used
# if fuller forms do not fit in the given space. These have no format
# restrictions and can contain e.g. space (this tends to make the
# first and second columns identical for most terms, which do not
# contain space). Surrounding space is ignored.

# Other aspects of visual presentation. The format is label (form used
# in other configurations, first of the labels) of the annotation
# separated by tab from comma-separated key:value pairs. The recognized
# keys, their values and purpose are:
# - Color     : any HTML color specification (e.g. "black"), sets 
#               the color of the span/arc in the visualization.
# - DashArray : any valid SVG stroke-dasharray specification, using
#               dashes (instead of commas or space) as separators
#               (e.g. "3-3"), sets the dash/dot pattern for lines
#               in the span/arc visualization
# The special label "DEFAULT" is recognized as setting the default
# that will be used for types without specific settings. It is
# not necessary to define all aspects of the visualization (e.g.
# DashArray can be omitted): defaults will be used for unspecified
# cases.
