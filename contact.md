## Issue Tracker ##

If you have found a bug or want to request a feature, please use [our issue
tracker at GitHub][github_issues]. Filing an issue ensures that it will be
brought to the attention of the developers and hopefully fixed for an upcoming
release and nightly build.

## Developers ##

You are encouraged to use the mailing list or the issue tracker, however, if
you feel that your issue/question requires direct communication with the brat
developers rather than the developers and the user-base please feel free to
contact us directly. We will attempt to reply promptly, but do keep in mind
that a response may take some time. Also, make sure to send your mail to all
of the developers below to make sure that your response is not delayed due to
a single developer not being available at the given time.
