    clientside:
        ask the server for possible options for span and arc types
        generate the form dynamically (or not at all, if only 1 type)
        add modifications to the form
        edit form on double-click
            (delete, toggle modifications)
    serverside:
        add span (from, to, type)
        add arc (origin, target, type)
            pay attention to Equiv (exceptional handling)
        delete span (id)
        delete arc (origin, target, type)
            pay attention to Equiv (exceptional handling)
