generate cover page

Annotation:
    extract all texts into a new text element
        so we don't select random stuff on chrome
        (with tspans, so safari can select all)
    draw an arc when dragging to add an arc
    serverside:
        add span (from, to, type)
        add arc (origin, target, type)
            pay attention to Equiv (exceptional handling)
        delete span (id)
        delete arc (origin, target, type)
            pay attention to Equiv (exceptional handling)
