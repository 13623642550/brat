<h1>brat downloads</h1>

<h2>Current release</h2>

<p>The most recent release of brat is v1.3 (Crunchy Frog).
  We recommend using this version.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="{{ site.dist.release_dir_url }}/{{ site.dist.latest_stable_tgz }}" onClick="javascript: _gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/releases/{{ site.dist.latest_stable_tgz }}']);">Download brat v1.3 (Crunchy Frog)</a> (released Nov. 8th 2012)</li>
</ul>

<p>After download, please see
the <a href="installation.html">installation instructions</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a previous installation of brat, we recommend
  installing the new version in a separate directory instead of "on
  top" of the previous version. Multiple installations of brat in
  different directories can coexist without conflicts on a single
  server (and even share data if so set up).
</p>
