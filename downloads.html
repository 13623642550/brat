<h1>brat downloads</h1>

<h2>Current release</h2>

<p>The most recent release of brat is version 1.2 (The Larch).
  We recommend using this version.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="{{ site.dist.release_dir_url }}{{ site.dist.latest_stable_tgz }}" onClick="javascript: _gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/releases/{{ site.dist.latest_stable_tgz }}']);">Download brat version 1.2 (The Larch)</a> (released Mar. 9th 2012)</li>
</ul>

<p>After download, please see
the <a href="installation.html">installation instructions</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a previous installation of brat, we recommend
  installing the new version in a separate directory instead of "on
  top" of the previous version. Multiple installations of brat in
  different directories can coexist without conflicts on a single
  server (and even share data if so set up).
</p>

<h2>Development branch</h2>

<p>
  New versions of brat are relased as our development branch stabilises and we
  reach specific milestones in our development.

  with any development branch) or you want to develop new features or help us
  bust bugs you should check out our <a href="https://github.com/nlplab/brat">
  GitHub repository</a> and check out the main branch.
